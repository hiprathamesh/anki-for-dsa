## Usage

1. **Fill in the Question Details**
   - Enter the question name
   - Select the question type (Array, String, etc.)
   - Choose difficulty level

2. **Add Approaches**
   - Document your approaches starting from Brute Force
   - Click '+' to add multiple approaches in each category
   - Select or enter custom time and space complexities
   - Remove additional approaches using the 'Ã—' button

3. **Copy and Share**
   - Use individual copy buttons for title or approaches

## Output Format

The generator creates two formatted text blocks:

1. **Title Format:**
```
Question Name (Type, Difficulty)
```

2. **Approaches Format:**
```
Brute: [Approach description]
TC: [Time Complexity] | SC: [Space Complexity]

Better: [Approach description]
TC: [Time Complexity] | SC: [Space Complexity]

Optimal: [Approach description]
TC: [Time Complexity] | SC: [Space Complexity]
```
